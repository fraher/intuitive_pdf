Read the pdf 2511.16043v1.pdf and understand the key concepts and nuances of the paper. Then come up with an analogy that has conceptual interactive components to describe it that someone could imagine manually working with. Then create a plan to build an interactive svg that allows users to effectively sense and feel the work the paper presents to get an intuitive feel for it. Add contextual descriptions to explain different parts of it. I should be able to run this as a web page and understand this paper, anyone should.
